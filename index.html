        <p>This website was originally created for personal use. However, as it developed, it became clear that it could serve as a valuable resource for those interested in Data Science. Here, you'll find my personal study notes, a record of my journey toward becoming a Data Scientist, and various resources such as roadmaps and relevant links to support others on a similar path.</p>
