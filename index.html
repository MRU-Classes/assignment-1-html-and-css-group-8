        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>
            This website was originally created for personal use. However, as it developed, it became clear that it could serve as a valuable resource for those interested in Data Science. Here, you'll find my personal study notes, a record of my journey toward becoming a Data Scientist, and various resources such as roadmaps and relevant links to support others on a similar path.

        <h2>Data Science</h2>

        <p>A <strong>data scientist</strong> is a professional who uses scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. Their work sits at the intersection of statistics, computer science, and domain expertise.</p>

        <h3>Key Responsibilities:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Collection and Cleaning:</strong> Gathering and preparing data for analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Understanding data patterns and trends.</li>
            <li><strong>Model Building:</strong> Creating predictive or descriptive models using statistical methods.</li>
            <li><strong>Interpretation and Communication:</strong> Explaining findings to stakeholders.</li>
            <li><strong>Deployment and Monitoring:</strong> Implementing and maintaining data models in production.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Required Skills:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Programming:</strong> Python, R</li>
            <li><strong>Statistics and Mathematics:</strong> Regression, probability, distributions</li>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Algorithms for prediction and pattern recognition</li>
            <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Tools like Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib</li>
            <li><strong>Business Acumen:</strong> Understanding domain-specific challenges</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Industries Where Data Scientists Work:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Healthcare</li>
            <li>Finance</li>
            <li>Marketing</li>
            <li>Technology</li>
            <li>Government and Public Policy</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In short, a data scientist turns raw data into strategic insights, helping organizations make informed decisions and gain a competitive advantage.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is <strong>Sary Sok</strong>, and I am a second-year Data Science student at Mount Royal University. 
            I am currently pursuing the university's Data Science program, which is outlined 
            <a href="https://catalog.mtroyal.ca/preview_program.php?catoid=33&poid=6574&returnto=2709#curriculum" target="_blank">Here</a>. 
            Within the program, I have chosen to concentrate on <strong>Computer Science and Big Data</strong> to deepen my understanding of computational methods and large-scale data analysis.
